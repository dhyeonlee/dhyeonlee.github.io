I'm a Staff Deep Learning Engineer at <u>Samsung Electronics</u>. 
At current, I'm on research and development on deep learning-based image processing algorithms for image enhancement such as demosaicing, super-resolution.
Before joining Samsung Electronics in 2019, I received a Ph.D. degree in <u>Electrical and Computer Engineering</u> from <u>Seoul National University</u>.
I received a B.S. degree in <u>Electronic Engineering</u> from <u>Sogang University</u>.
I have domain knowledge not only of deep learning-based algorithms but also in designing hardware accelerators. 
My research interests include deep learning-based computer vision, object detection and tracking, and image compression.
